# Functional Programming Mathematics
Category theory as an abstract branch of math that can formalize concepts from other branches such as Set, Type, Group, Logic and others.
# Monoids and Monads

#### Generalizations

- Closure
    - The type is "closed" since it only accepts the same type it is passed.
    
    - Any pairwise op can run on lists
- Associativity
    - Any combination of monoids 
    is also a monoid
- Identity
